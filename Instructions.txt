XPostBot Instructions

Dependables:
- Very important: Python version BEFORE 3.11. Tweepy requires imghdr to upload images, and this module is not available in the newer versions of Python.
- MacOS and Terminal with nohup to run the process in the background.
- X Developer free tier.
- X Developer API credentials.

1. Add your API Key, API Secret Key, Access Token, and Access Token Secret to the .py file, within the quotations on lines 6 through 9.

2. Remove lines 71 through 75 so the automation will only post images in chronological order.

3. Replace "/image/path/here" in line 53 with the file path to the required images.

4. Ensure that the image name scheme is modified in lines 57 and 61, or change the image name scheme to frame1.png, frame2.png, etc. 

5. Modify lines 56, 61, and 67 to include the correct number of image files. 

6. Save the .py file as a globally unique name.

7. Open Terminal and enter this command: 

        pip install tweepy

8. Once Tweepy installs, enter this command with the & at the end to run the .py file in the background: 

        nohup python3 [yourfilename].py &

9. Find the process ID of the automation with this:

ps aux | grep [yourfilename].py

10. Use this command to kill the process (with PID replaced with the process ID):

kill -9 <PID>
